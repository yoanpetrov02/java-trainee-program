# java-trainee-program

## Overview

This repository was created to contain all the code I've written for Sirma Solutions' Java trainee program.\
\
The modules cover the following Java topics:
* Introduction to Java
* Objects in Java
* Libraries and classpath, Maven
* Exceptions
* Annotations, Regex, Reflection
* Input-Output (files, i/o streams)
* Collections
* Design patterns
* Threads
* Networkinig and GUI

## Introduction to Java

This topic is mainly for getting to know Java's syntax and method flow, as well as arrays and strings. Problems include:

- Basic syntax
- Arrays
- String mainpulation
- Reading user input from the console.

## Objects in Java

This topic focuses on object-oriented programming and how Java is all about objects. It covers all OOP principles - abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, as well as Java Generic types and UML class diagrams. Problems include:

- Defining a hierarchy of objects
- Defining classes
- Working with tree data structures
- Creating generic classes
- Creating UML class diagrams.

## Libraries and classpath

The tasks from this part are centered around Java external libraries and dependencies, and how tedious it is to manage them without a helping tool. It also covers packaging jar files and manifest files. The tasks include:

- Packaging the last task of the first topic as an executable .jar file
- Package code as a reusable module
- Starting to use Maven
- Converting the old projects to Maven projects
- Learning the basics of Maven, how to use it and why it's so useful for managing projects.

## Exceptions

The Exceptions topic focuses on exception handling, checked and unchecked exceptions and custom exceptions. Tasks cover:

- try-catch and try-catch-finally statements
- Checked and unchecked exceptions
- Custom exception classes.

## Reflection, Annotations and Regex

One of the larger topics, this one contains tasks about 3 of the most important parts of the language - Reflection, Annotations and the Regex support. This topic includes:

- Learning what reflection is, why it is so powerful and the way it allows fine-grained control over everything
- Learning what you should **Not** use reflection for
- Annotations and the way they can be used with reflection
- Learning how to work with regular expressions.

## Input-Output

This topic is mainly focused around working with files an i/o streams. Includes:

- The try-with-resources statement and why it's important to use it
- Scanners
- Reeading from files
- Writing to files
- Learning why you can't just read a whole file into memory, but rather have to do it chunk by chunk to avoid out of memory errors
- Transferring objects between streams
- Listing contents of directories
- Serialization/deserialization.

## Collections

The Collections topic contains tasks covering the Collections API in Java, lambda expressions, pagination, hash maps, lists, and other data structures.

- Hash maps
- Paging algorithms
- Lists
- LRU cache data structure and others.

## Design patterns

The tasks from this topic are designed to cover the more commonly used design patterns when writing clean Java code. They include:

- Abstract factory and Factory method patterns
- Fluent API and Builder pattern
- Singleton pattern
- Object pool
- Proxy pattern
- Observer pattern
- Command pattern.

## Threads

The Threads topic is about learning the basics of concurrent applications and common synchronization problems. Tasks cover:

- Atomic variables
- Synchronizing threads
- sleep() and wait()
- The Thread class vs Runnable interface
- Producer-Consumer problem
- Timeout hashtable implementation
- Executors.

## Networking and GUI

The final topic of the program contains tasks about networking and creating desktop applications with a graphical user interface:

- Using JavaFX or Swing for UI
- Each task of this topic is a GUI app
- Working with URLs and downloading files from a URL
- Client-Server architecture
- TCP and UDP protocols
- UDP Multicasting
- Mediator design pattern
- Memento design pattern
- MVC architecture.

## Final task

The final task of the trainee program was to create an instant messaging chat application using the learned principles. This task is in another repository, where I've fully documented it.\
